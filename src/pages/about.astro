		<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

		<p>
			I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the
			second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
		</p>

		<p>
			This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep
			checking back and see how my journey is going!
